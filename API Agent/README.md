# Dialogflow Agent
The Dialogflow agent can be found [here](https://github.com/HarvsG/r-SpaceX-AI-Bot/tree/master/API%20Agent/r-SpaceX-AI).

This folder is not part of the webhook and is not needed to deploy the webhook.

You can use your own implementation of the agent by going to [Dialogflow](https://dialogflow.com)
  - Sign Up or Log In
  - Create a new agent
  - Click the cog wheel next to the agent name
  - Go to Export and Import
  - Click "RESTORE FROM ZIP"
  - Choose a ZIPed file of the [above contents](https://github.com/HarvsG/r-SpaceX-AI-Bot/tree/master/API%20Agent/r-SpaceX-AI)
Note - You may use and edit this on condition you do not submit it to google for approval

If you would like to contribute to the testing or development or testing please contact me using my github email and consider joining the [r/SpaceX github](https://github.com/r-spacex) community and/or [slack](rspacexgithub.slack.com).
